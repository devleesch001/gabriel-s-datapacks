# Stackable Items

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This datapack is only supported on 1.20.5 and above (inclusing release candidates, pre-releases and snapshots from 24w10a on)

Maximize your inventory space with the Stackable Items Datapack! This datapack allows you to stack various items, such as totems, boats, signs, buckets, and more, up to 64 per slot.

<!-- TODO add prints -->

## Known Limitations

All of the supportem items will work if achieved from drops (mob drops, block drops, etc) or crafting (crafting table, auto crafter, etc). However, items obtained from the creative inventory, loot chests or items stored prior to the installation of this datapack will not be stackable by default. **To make those items stackable, you can simply drop them in the ground and pick them up again**.

Also, on recipes that use the items modified to be stackable (such as crafting a chest boat with stackable boats), will not auto-fill the items in the crafting grid when using the recipe book. You can still see the recipe and craft them normally, it just won't auto fill.

Buckets won't be 64-stackable when you get them from emptying a water/lava bucket or using a lava bucket in a furnace or using a milk bucket in cake recipes. You can always drop them to fix it.
